# SudokuSolve

SudokuSolve is a program which solves Sudoku puzzles.
The Wikipedia article (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) for Sudoku explains the rules as follows:

In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 x 3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all the digits from 1 to 9.
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
